   	<h7>Horwich v. Superior Court</h7><br/>
   	June 1, 2012<br/></p>

	<div class="newsContent">
		     <i>A wrongful death plaintiff whose decedent was the uninsured operator killed in an auto accident is not barred by Proposition 213 from recovering damages for loss of care, comfort and society.</i>
	</div>
	<div class="newsContent">Proposition 213, approved by the voters in November, 1996, prevents recovery by an uninsured vehicle operator or uninsured vehicle owner of non-economic damages for pain, suffering, inconvenience, physical impairment, disfigurement and other nonpecuniary damages. Plaintiffs, parents of a driver who had no personal automobile insurance or insurance for the vehicle she was driving, brought suit for survival causes of action. Defendant contended Proposition 213 barred recovery for loss of care, comfort and society. The California Supreme Court held the purpose of Proposition 213 is to punish drivers and automobile owners who do not comply with the state's financial responsibility laws and does not apply to other persons involved in an automobile accident involving uninsured motorists or vehicles. The court also noted that the passenger of an uninsured driver involved in an accident with an insured driver would also not be limited to economic damages since such a result would not be consistent with the electorate's ostensible narrow purpose to penalize scofflaws.
