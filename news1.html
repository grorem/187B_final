   	<h7>Cates Construction, Inc. v. Talbot Partners</h7><br/>
   	June 6, 2012<br/></p>

	<div class="newsContent"><i>A performance bond surety cannot be held liable for tortious breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing.</i>
	</div>
	<div class="newsContent">Talbot Partners hired Cates Construction to build a condominium project in Malibu. Talbot financed the project through the Bank of Montecito. The financing was conditioned on the issuance of a performance bond. Transamerica Insurance Company issued performance and payment bonds in favor of Talbot as obligee and the bank as co-obligee. Completion of the project was significantly delayed. Talbot alleged Cates had been overpaid, yet Cates had not completed the project and finally advised that it would default on the project. When Talbot and the Bank informed Transamerica that Cates was in default and that the bank was foreclosing on the project, there were significant mechanics' liens on file against the project, including Cates' lien. Transamerica filed an action to foreclose on Cates' mechanic's lien and subsequently began completion of the project under the performance bond.
	</div>
	<div class="newsContent">The contract issues were tried, by stipulation, before a retired California Supreme Court Justice who found that Cates had breached its contract and had caused all delays beyond a specified date. He also found that Transamerica breached the performance bond by failing to adequately investigate, by joining the mechanic's lien lawsuit without proper investigation, and by arbitrarily determining what work it would perform. Significant contract damages were awarded to Talbot and to the Bank.
	</div>
	<div class="newsContent">
	After the contract issues were tried, the tort cause of action for bad faith was tried to a jury. The jury awarded $28 million in punitive damages which were reduced on appeal to $15 million.
	</div>
	<div class="newsContent">
	The California Supreme Court held, first, that a surety's liability for delay damages is determined by reference to the bond and the underlying construction contract. Relying on principles of contract interpretation, the court held the surety liable for delay damages arising from Cates' failure to meet agreed time requirements and rejected the argument that the surety only obligated itself to performance of the construction, not to damages for any delay in that construction. In regard to bad faith, the Court reiterated that tort damages for breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing are only available in cases involving insurance policies. The court found significant distinctions between the tripartite construction surety relationships and an insurance policy (incidentally noting that fidelity bonds are "two party contracts" that resemble traditional insurance more than surety bonds). After a thorough analysis of principles of suretyship and the typical function of construction bonds, the court held that recovery for a surety's breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing is properly limited to contract damages. Neither tort damages or punitive damages are available for such a breach.
